What is a database and how is it different from a spreadsheet?

Fundamentally, a database is a computer program designed to store, manipulate, and retrieve information. Databases use tables as a means of storing and retrieving information. Tables are organized as columns (fields) and rows (records). This tabular structure is similar to spreadsheets, but unlike a spreadsheet, most databases are relational, meaning that data between tables can be linked and cross-referenced.

Typically in a spreadsheet, the information is formatted. Therefore, adding new data can be tedious. Since database tables store the raw data without formatting, data entry is easier. Many databases have forms or user-interfaces designed to facilitate data entry and editing. Mechanisms to easily retrieve data are also generally available to the database user. Data can be sorted based on any field and reports can be generated that contain only certain fields from each record without changing the source data. Data reports apply formatting after the data is extracted from the database.

Why a database rather than a spreadsheet?

Spreadsheets are great for numeric and text values in relatively low volume. Databases also expertly handle numeric and text values but can easily incorporate other types of information, such as images and documents. Databases can also accommodate high volume and large file size data downloads.

Because databases store information more efficiently, databases can handle volumes of information that would be unmanageable in a spreadsheet. Spreadsheets have record limitations whereas databases do not. Compared to databases, spreadsheets can require a large amount of hard-drive space for data storage.

Updates to databases are typically easier than spreadsheets, especially if the same information is maintained in multiple records or multiple spreadsheets. 

Although data in spreadsheets can be sorted and filtered, a database has broad querying functionality that can retrieve all records matching select criteria, cross-reference records in multiple tables, and perform complex aggregate calculations across multiple tables. Therefore, databases provide a flexibility to sort and present data in a myriad of ways that would be nearly impossible to do with two-dimensional spreadsheets. Many databases also provide means to automate query and report generation using stored procedures.
Databases are designed to refer to information without loading all the information into memory, unlike spreadsheets. Therefore, databases operate faster than spreadsheets when handling large datasets. And spreadsheets have memory limitations.

Data integrity is a key difference between databases and spreadsheets. Relational databases follow standardized integrity rules to ensure that the data they contain are accurate and accessible.

Preventing and efficiently identifying data errors in spreadsheets is challenging.  
It is also much easier to accidentally overwrite or delete data in a spreadsheet than in a database.

Unlike spreadsheets, modern relational databases are designed for multiple users. For circumstances that require many users to share information, add new data, and/or make changes to data, a spreadsheet is a bad choice. Databases are ideal for sharing and collaboration of information.
